                <p>"In this world, there is nothing so 
                    purifying as knowledge. One who has
                     attained perfection in yoga, finds it
                     within himself in due course of time."</p>

                <p>"Therefore, without being attached to the
                     fruits of activities, one should act as 
                     a matter of duty; for by working 
                    without attachment, one attains 
                    the Supreme."</p>

                <p>"Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics,
                     and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer,
                      there will also certainly be opulence, victory,
                     extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion."</p>
